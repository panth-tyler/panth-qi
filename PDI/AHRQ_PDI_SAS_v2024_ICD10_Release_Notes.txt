Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDI) Software Version SAS v2024
RELEASE DATE: July 2024
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's all-payer software is named SAS QI v2024
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

- Reflects coding changes based on fiscal year 2024 coding updates to the International Classification 
  of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS). These 
  coding changes impact all software modules.
- Includes modified code sets, labels, and output in multiple modules. See log of changes for 
  indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Updates risk-adjustment, signal variance, and reference population rates using data from the 2019, 2020, 
  and 2021 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID).
  The AHRQ SAS v2024 utilizes three years of data (2019-2021) in the reference population for hospital level
  indicators and one year of data (2021) for area level indicators.
  In the PDI module, the following changes are new in v2024:
     • For hospital-level indicators, the software no longer provides options to include or exclude COVID 
       discharges. The risk adjustment models have accounted for the case-mix by considering the 
       diagnosis of COVID present on admission as well as a COVID time trend. 
     • For area level indicators, the software removes the option allowing users to select the year for the 
       risk-adjustment model. This option is no longer needed since risk-adjusted scores are based on a 
       single year of data (2021).
- Revised Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) Requirements
     • SAS QI v2024 now includes additional checks on user input for MDC_PROVIDED to avoid software errors. 
       In the case where MDC_PROVIDED is not 0 or 1, or if MDC_PROVIDED = 1 but the MDC values are out of range of 
       0-25, the software will not execute to avoid errors or unexpected results. 
     • Different versions of the Medicare Severity-Diagnostic Related Group (MS-DRG) grouper produce
       slightly different results with respect to certain high resource intensity MS-DRGs. Specifically, MSDRGs
       001-019 and 981-989 are classified as "pre-MDC" MS-DRGs, which means that they are
       associated with such high length of stay and/or cost that they supersede the usual assignment of MSDRGs
       within body system or MDC categories. For records assigned to these MS-DRGs, some versions of
       the grouper software retain the MDC that would be assigned based on the principal diagnosis and
       procedure codes, whereas other versions of the grouper software overwrite the MDC assignment with a
       blank, missing, or nonnumeric value such as "PRE." Thus, users MUST PROVIDE the MDC generated
       by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) MS-DRG grouper software, without imputing
       or mapping from MS-DRGs. For accurate results, all eligible records should have an MDC between 01
       and 25. For those users who need to construct MDC, please view the documentation and software
       available here: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/icd-10-ms-drg-definitions-manual-files-v411.zip.
     • CMS' MS-DRG grouper software is updated on October 1 of each year, to accommodate new ICD-10-CM/PCS 
       codes introduced on that date, and it is further updated on any other date when new codes take
       effect. As a result, the grouper software version that worked on discharge records dated between January
       1 and September 30 of any calendar year does NOT work correctly on discharge records dated between
       October 1 and December 31 of the same calendar year. MS-DRG grouper software is designed for
       backward compatibility, based on the discharge date of each record. Therefore, a user who wishes to
       analyze CY 2023 data must use the version 41 (FY 2024) grouper (or later), while a user who wishes to
       analyze CY 2022 data must use the version 40 (FY 2023) grouper (or later). Many errors will result if a
       user applies the version 40 (FY 2023) grouper to data from the last quarter of CY 2023.
- Requires Procedure Days (PRDAYn). The PDI module will suppress expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, 
  for measures that use PRDAYn information (PDI 08 and 09) when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete. 
  Users should set the PRDAY macro variable to "0" in the PDI CONTROL programs when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete 
  on the input data. Note that input data with missing or incomplete PRDAYn may impact numerators,
  denominators, and observed rates for these PDIs that use PRDAYn information.
- Continues to provide the option to produce stratified rates. Expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, 
  and composites are suppressed in certain situations. Because age, gender, age in days, and birth weight are 
  used in risk adjustment models, it is inappropriate to produce risk-adjusted rates for any stratum that includes these variables.
- Updates QI population file estimates covering the years 2000 through 2023 using US Census Bureau data. 
  Please see the population file methodology at:

Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDI) Software Version SAS v2023
Release date: AUGUST 2023
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's all-payers version is named SAS QI v2023
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

- Reflects coding changes based on fiscal year 2023 coding updates to the International Classification 
  of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS). 
  These coding changes impact all software modules.
- Includes modified code sets, labels, and output in multiple modules. 
  See log of changes for indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Includes risk-adjustment, signal variance, and reference population rates using data from the 2019, 2020, 
  and 2021 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID).
  The AHRQ SAS v2023 utilizes three years of data (2019-2021) in the reference population for hospital level
  indicators and two years of data (2019-2020) for area level indicators.
- Includes new and updated risk factors in the risk-adjustment models. The use of multiple years of 
  data serves several purposes, such as incorporating quarterly COVID-19 controls into the risk adjustment models
  and providing more robust estimation for hospital-level indicators with low observed rates. 
  For area level indicators, v2023 allows users to select the appropriate year for the denominator as well as 
  for the risk-adjustment model, providing risk-adjusted scores appropriate to either a pandemic period (2020) 
  or a non-pandemic period (2019), according to user preference.
  In the PDI module, the following changes are new in v2023:
     • For hospital-level indicators, the risk-adjustment models account for COVID-19 and use quarterly 
	   COVID-time interaction terms to account for changes in the association between COVID and the indicator 
	   outcomes across 2020 and 2021. Only COVID-19 that is present on admission is accounted for during risk adjustment.
- Revised Major Diagnostic Category (MDC) Requirements
     • Users must have major diagnostic categories (MDC) assigned for each discharge on their input file. 
	   MDCs are used in measure specifications. Since v2022, the AHRQ software does not impute MDC because the
       calculation was error-prone when the correct classification software was not applied to the input data.
       However, running the MS-DRG grouper is challenging for some users, so v2023 creates new assignments
       for MDC 14 (obstetrics) and MDC 15 (neonates), based on the diagnosis codes from MDC 14 and MDC
       15 code lists, in order to allow users to generate risk-adjusted, smoothed, or composite rates for hospital-level
       indicators where MDC 14 or MDC 15 are used in the measure specifications. 
	   Starting with v2023,the area-level indicators no longer require MDCs. Consequently, the MDC_PROVIDED option does 
	   not have any impact on the software, and the software will not suppress risk-adjusted rates and smoothed rates.
	 • Users should set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variable to "0" in the CONTROL program
       when MDC is missing or incomplete on the input data. If MDC is available and fully coded, users should
       set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variables to "1". If users set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variable to
       "1" in the CONTROL program, but a few MDC values are missing on input data, the software will
       exclude those discharges with missing MDCs. Additionally, if users set the MDC_PROVIDED macro
       variable to "1" in the CONTROL program, but all MDC values are missing on input data, the software
       will output an error message – "ERROR: MDC_PROVIDED = 1 in CONTROL program but all MDC
       values are missing on input data." In this scenario, users should set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variable
       to "0" in the CONTROL program.
     • Different versions of the Medicare Severity-Diagnostic Related Group (MS-DRG) grouper produce
       slightly different results with respect to certain high resource intensity MS-DRGs. Specifically, MSDRGs
       001-019 and 981-989 are classified as "pre-MDC" MS-DRGs, which means that they are
       associated with such high length of stay and/or cost that they supersede the usual assignment of MSDRGs
       within body system or MDC categories. For records assigned to these MS-DRGs, some versions of
       the grouper software retain the MDC that would be assigned based on the principal diagnosis and
       procedure codes, whereas other versions of the grouper software overwrite the MDC assignment with a
       blank, missing, or nonnumeric value such as "PRE." Thus, users MUST PROVIDE the MDC generated
       by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) MS-DRG grouper software, without imputing
       or mapping from MS-DRGs. For accurate results, all eligible records should have an MDC between 01
       and 25. For those users who need to construct MDC, please view the documentation and software
       available here: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/icd-10-ms-drgs-v401-effective-april-1-2023.zip.
     • CMS' MS-DRG grouper software is updated on October 1 of each year, to accommodate new ICD-10-CM/PCS 
	   codes introduced on that date, and it is further updated on any other date when new codes take
       effect. As a result, the grouper software version that worked on discharge records dated between January
       1 and September 30 of any calendar year does NOT work correctly on discharge records dated between
       October 1 and December 31 of the same calendar year. MS-DRG grouper software is designed for
       backward compatibility, based on the discharge date of each record. Therefore, a user who wishes to
       analyze CY 2022 data must use the version 40 (FY 2023) grouper (or later), while a user who wishes to
       analyze CY 2021 data must use the version 39 (FY 2022) grouper (or later). Many errors will result if a
       user applies the version 39 (FY 2022) grouper to data from the last quarter of CY 2022.
- Requires Procedure Days (PRDAYn). The PDI module will suppress expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, 
  for measures that use PRDAYn information (PDI 08 and 09) when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete. 
  Users should set the PRDAY macro variable to "0" in the PDI CONTROL programs when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete 
  on the input data. Note that input data with missing or incomplete PRDAYn may impact numerators,
  denominators, and observed rates for these PDIs that use PRDAYn information.
- Includes methodology to adjust for COVID-19 discharges for hospital-level indicators. 
  Users have the following options to specify how to handle COVID discharges in the CONTROL program for each module:
	• Option 1: The user can exclude COVID discharges. The software will only calculate numerators,
      denominators, and observed rates.
	• Option 2 (default): The user can include all discharges, with and without COVID. This is
      recommended and is therefore the default choice. The software will calculate risk-adjusted rates,
      smoothed rates, and composites.
	• Option 3: The user can include only COVID discharges. The software will only calculate
      numerators, denominators, and observed rates.
  In v2022, because the 2019 HCUP reference population pre-dated the public health emergency, the
  software suppressed expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites for hospital
  indicators when a user includes COVID-19 discharges. For v2023, the reference population and risk
  adjustment models for hospital-level indicators incorporates HCUP data from 2019 to 2021 and allows
  for a COVID (present on admission) indicator. As a result, it is recommended that users utilize the default
  option 2 when calculating expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed rates, or composite rates, as this option
  adjusts for COVID-19. For options 1 and 3, the software will suppress the expected, risk-adjusted, and
  smoothed rates.
- Continues to provide the option to produce stratified rates. Expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, 
  and composites are suppressed in certain situations. Because age, gender, age in days, and birth weight are 
  used in risk adjustment models, it is inappropriate to produce risk-adjusted rates for any stratum that includes these variables.
- Updated QI population file estimates covering the years 2000 through 2022 using US Census Bureau data.

Pediatric Quality Indicators Software Version SAS v2022.0.1
Release date: SEPTEMBER 2022
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2022.0.1
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Updated the risk-adjustment program to remove the unintentional capping of observed-to-expected
  (risk-adjusted) ratios above 1.0. Ratios greater than 1.0 may now be observed. The program 
  will also limit lower-bound confidence interval estimates for both risk-adjusted rates and
  ratios at 0.0 and consistently includes columns for stratification variables in the TXT 
  output for all QI modules.
- For more information see the document "Stratification of Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQI),
  Patient Safety Indicators (PSI), and Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDI)" on the AHRQ QI website.
- Previous Release Notes for v2022 below also apply to v2022.0.1.

=============================================================================================
Pediatric Quality Indicators Software Version SAS v2022
Release date: JULY 2022
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2022
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Added support for fiscal year 2022 code updates dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
  Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
  These coding changes impact all software modules.
- Modified setnames, labels, and outputs in multiple modules. See log of changes for indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Updated risk-adjustment, signal variance, reference population rates, and composite weights for PSI, IQI, PDI, 
  and PQI modules using the 2019 HCUP state inpatient databases.
- AHRQ SAS QI v2022 includes new and updated risk factors in the risk-adjustment models. For hospital-level indicators 
  in the PDI module, the following changes are new in v2022:
	• Updated Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) in the risk-adjustment models are based on the 
      patient's admission diagnoses and use present on admission (POA) information on the patient's discharge record.
- Users must have major diagnostic categories (MDC) assigned for each discharge on their input file. MDCs are used in measure specifications.
  The AHRQ v2022 software no longer imputes MDC as in v2021 since the calculation is error-prone when 
  the correct classification software is not applied to the input data. Different versions of the Medicare 
  Severity-Diagnostic Related Group (MS-DRG) grouper produce slightly different results with respect to certain high 
  resource intensity MS-DRGs. Specifically, MS-DRGs 001-019 and 981-989 are classified as "pre-MDC" MS-DRGs, which means
  that they are associated with such high length of stay and/or cost that they supersede the usual assignment of MS-DRGs
  within body system or MDC categories. For records assigned to these MS-DRGs, some versions of the grouper software retain
  the MDC that would be assigned based on the principal diagnosis and procedure codes, whereas other versions of the grouper
  software overwrite the MDC assignment with a blank, missing, or nonnumeric value such as "PRE." 
  Thus, users MUST PROVIDE the MDC generated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) MS-DRG grouper software, 
  without imputing or mapping from MS-DRGs. For accurate results, all eligible records should have an MDC between 01 and 25. 
  For those users who need to construct MDC, please view the documentation and software available here:
  https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/icd-10-ms-drgs-v391-effective-april-1-2022.zip.
- Users should set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variable to "0" in the CONTROL program when MDC is missing or incomplete on the input data. 
  If MDC is available and fully coded, users should set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variables to "1". 
  If users set the MDC_PROVIDED macro variable to "1" in the CONTROL  program, but MDC values are missing on input data, 
  the software will exclude those discharges with missing MDCs and output an error message – "ERROR: MDC_PROVIDED = 1 in 
  CONTROL program but all MDC values are missing on input data".    
- Procedure Day (PRDAY) is a requirement in v2022. Starting with AHRQ SAS QI v2021, the PDI module will suppress expected rates, 
  risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites for measures that use PRDAYn information (PDI 08, 09) when PRDAYn is missing
  or incomplete. Users should set the PRDAY macro variable to ‘0' in the PDI CONTROL program when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete
  on the input data. Note that input data with missing or incomplete PRDAYn may impact numerators, denominators, and observed rates for these
  PDIs that use PRDAYn information. 
- In AHRQ software v2022, users continue to have two options to calibrate smoothed rates and composite values using observed to expected ratio: 
	• Option 1: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 1 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate using the 2019 HCUP reference population 
      observed-to-expected (O-E) ratio. This is recommended and is therefore the default choice.
	• Option 2: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 0 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate to the O-E ratio of the user's input data. 
      This option is provided to large health care systems or states who want to calibrate the predicted QI rates within the system. 
      Starting with AHRQ SAS QI v2021, there is a new step in the software to rescale the predicted probabilities if the O/E calibration 
      pushes them above 1.0. The caveat is that the interpretation of the rates may be different since the software would still use 2019 
      HCUP reference population rate as multiplier for risk adjustment rates.
  For more details about the O-E ratio adjustment, please refer to the Empirical Methods document.
  https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Resources/Publications/2022/Empirical_Methods_2022.pdf
- The AHRQ SAS QI v2022 continues to include methodology to account for COVID-19 discharges for hospital-level indicators. Starting with 
  AHRQ SAS QI v2021 in modules that include hospital-level indicators (IQI, PDI, PSI), the user has the following options to specify 
  how to handle COVID-19 discharges in the CONTROL program for each module: 
	• Option 1: The user can exclude COVID-19 discharges. This is recommended and is therefore the default choice. The software will 
	  calculate risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites.
	• Option 2: The user can include all discharges, with and without COVID-19. The software will only calculate numerators, denominators, 
	  and observed rates.
	• Option 3: The user can include only COVID-19 discharges. The software will only calculate numerators, denominators, and observed rates.
- Because the 2019 HCUP reference population pre-dates the public health emergency, the software will suppress expected rates, risk-adjusted 
  rates, smoothed rates, and composites for hospital indicators when a user includes COVID-19 discharges. In other words, users can only 
  calculate expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed rates, or composites when they select the default to exclude COVID-19 discharges. This approach 
  is consistent with the previously published user guidance. We will continue to monitor the published evidence on COVID-19 and update user 
  guidance as necessary.
  COVID-19 User Guidance is available here: https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Resources/COVID19_UserNote_July2021.pdf
- AHRQ SAS QI software users continue to have the option to produce stratified rates in v2022. Starting in AHRQ SAS QI v2021, expected rates, 
  risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites will be suppressed in certain situations for hospital level indicators. Because age, 
  gender, age in days, and birth weight are used in risk adjustment models, it is inappropriate to produce risk-adjusted rates for any 
  stratum that includes these variables.
- Updated QI population file to use intercensal and postcensal estimates of county-level population by single-year age group, sex, race,
  and Hispanic origin covering the years 2000 through 2021 are from the US Census Bureau. The new population file uses Census estimates for 
  single year age population to create AHRQ age bands. Please see the details around the population file methodology at:

Pediatric Quality Indicators Software Version SAS v2021.0.1
Release date: SEPTEMBER 2021
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2021.0.1
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Updated PDI_ALL_MEASURES.SAS to fix the issue in SAS QI v2021 when Option 1 or Option 3 were selected in 
  the CONTROL program for COVID-19 exclusions and users had 2020 data in their input file. This issue resulted 
  in no COVID-19 diagnosis-based exclusions for 2020 data in IQI, PDI, and PSI hospital-level indicators. 
  This issue is now fixed in SAS QI v2021.0.1 software and COVID-19 diagnosis-based exclusions are accurately 
  accounted for in computing rates with 2020 data when Option 1 or Option 3 are selected in the CONTROL program.
- For more information see previously released document Update to COVID-19 Exclusions in v2021 Software, available here:

=============================================================================================
Pediatric Quality Indicators Software Version SAS v2021
Release date: JULY 2021
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2021.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Added support for fiscal year 2021 code updates dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
  Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
  These coding changes impact all software modules.
- Modified setnames, labels, and outputs in multiple modules. See log of changes for indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Updated risk-adjustment, signal variance, reference population rates, and composite weights for PSI, IQI, PDI, 
  and PQI modules using the 2018 HCUP state inpatient databases.
- AHRQ SAS QI v2021 includes new and updated risk factors in the risk-adjustment models. For hospital-level indicators 
  in the PDI module, 
	• Updated. Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) in the risk-adjustment models are based on the 
      patient's admission diagnoses and use present on admission (POA) information on the patient's discharge record.
	• New in v2021. Count of comorbidities from the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined  is included in certain 
      risk-adjustment models.
	• New in v2021. A risk factor indicating whether a discharge is medical or surgical is used in risk-adjustment 
      models for certain indicators that include both medical and surgical discharges.
- Users interested in calculating expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed, or composite values for hospital-level indicators must 
  have major diagnostic categories (MDCs) assigned for each discharge on their input file. MDCs are used in measure 
  specifications and risk adjustment, and although the QI software includes a macro to calculate MDC, it does not account 
  for assignments for pre-MDC DRGs or multiple trauma cases (MDC 24). Different versions of the MS-DRG grouper produce 
  slightly different results with respect to certain high resource intensity MS-DRGs. Specifically, MS-DRGs 001-017 
  and 981-989 are classified as "preMDC" MS-DRGs, which means that they are associated with such high length of stay and/or 
  cost that they supersede the usual assignment of MS-DRGs within body system or MDC categories. For records assigned to 
  these MS-DRGs, some versions of the grouper software retain the MDC that would be assigned based on the principal diagnosis 
  and procedure codes, whereas other versions of the grouper software overwrite the MDC assignment with a blank, missing, or 
  nonnumeric value such as "PRE." For those users who need to construct MDC, please view the documentation and software 
  available here: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/icd-10-ms-drgs-v381-effective-january-1-2021.zip
- Starting with AHRQ SAS QI v2021, the PDI module will suppress expected rates, risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and 
  composites for measures that use PRDAYn information (PDI 08, 09) when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete. Users should set
  the PRDAY macro variable to ‘0' in the PDI CONTROL program when PRDAYn is missing or incomplete on the input data. 
  Note that input data with missing or incomplete PRDAYn may impact numerators, denominators, and observed rates for these
  PDIs that use PRDAYn information.
- In AHRQ software v2021, the user has two options to calibrate smoothed rates and composite values using observed to expected ratio: 
	• Option 1: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 1 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate using the 2018 HCUP reference population 
      observed-to-expected (O-E) ratio. This is recommended and is therefore the default choice.
	• Option 2: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 0 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate to the O-E ratio of the user's input data. 
      This option is provided to large health care systems or states who want to calibrate the predicted QI rates within the system. 
      Starting with AHRQ SAS QI v2021, there is a new step in the software to rescale the predicted probabilities if the O/E calibration 
      pushes them above 1.0. The caveat is that the interpretation of the rates may be different since the software would still use 2018 
      HCUP reference population rate as multiplier for risk adjustment rates.
  For more details about the O-E ratio adjustment, please refer to the Empirical Methods document.
  https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Resources/Publications/2021/Empirical_Methods_2021.pdf
- The AHRQ SAS QI v2021 now includes methodology to account for COVID-19 discharges for hospital-level indicators. Starting with 
  AHRQ SAS QI v2021 in modules that include hospital-level indicators (IQI, PDI, PSI), the user has the following options to specify 
  how to handle COVID discharges in the CONTROL program for each module: 
	• Option 1: The user can exclude COVID discharges. This is recommended and is therefore the default choice. The software will 
	  calculate risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites.
	• Option 2: The user can include all discharges, with and without COVID. The software will only calculate numerators, denominators, 
	  and observed rates.
	• Option 3: The user can include only COVID discharges. The software will only calculate numerators, denominators, and observed rates.
- Because the 2018 HCUP reference population pre-dates the public health emergency, the software will suppress expected rates, risk-adjusted 
  rates, smoothed rates, and composites for hospital indicators when a user includes COVID-19 discharges. In other words, users can only 
  calculate expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed rates, or composites when they select the default to exclude COVID-19 discharges. This approach 
  is consistent with the previously published user guidance. We will continue to monitor the published evidence on COVID and update user 
  guidance as necessary.
  COVID-19 User Guidance is available here: https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Resources/User_note_COVID.pdf
- AHRQ SAS QI software users continue to have the option to produce stratified rates. Starting in AHRQ SAS QI v2021, expected rates, 
  risk-adjusted rates, smoothed rates, and composites will be suppressed in certain situations for hospital level indicators. Because age, 
  gender, age in days, and birth weight are used in risk adjustment models, it is inappropriate to produce risk-adjusted rates for any 
  stratum that includes these variables.
- Udpdated QI population file to use intercensal and postcensal estimates of county-level population by single-year age group, sex, race,
  and Hispanic origin covering the years 2000 are through 2020 from the US Census Bureau. The new population file uses Census estimates for 
  single year age population to create AHRQ age bands. Please see the details around the population file methodology at:

Pediatric Quality Indicators Software Version SAS v2020
Release date: JULY 2020
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2020.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Added support for fiscal year 2020 code updates dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
  Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through March 31, 2020. 
  The SAS QI v2020 ICD-10-CM/PCS software does not reflect coding updates effective April 1, 2020. 
  These coding changes impact all software modules.
- Modified setnames, labels, and outputs in multiple modules. See log of changes for indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Updated area risk-adjustment, signal variance, reference population rates, and composite weights 
  using the 2017 HCUP state inpatient databases.
- Added hospital-level risk-adjustment, signal variance, reference population rates, and composite weights 
  using the 2017 HCUP state inpatient databases.  
- Users interested in calculating expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed, or composite values must have major diagnostic categories (MDCs)
  assigned for each discharge on their input file. MDCs are used in risk adjustment, and although the QI software includes a macro to 
  calculate MDC, it does not account for assignments for pre-MDC DRGs or multiple trauma cases (MDC 24). Different versions of the MS-DRG
  grouper produce slightly different results with respect to certain high resource intensity MS-DRGs. Specifically, MS-DRGs 001-017 
  and 981-989 are classified as "preMDC" MS-DRGs, which means that they are associated with such high length of stay and/or cost that
  they supersede the usual assignment of MS-DRGs within body system or MDC categories. For records assigned to these MS-DRGs, some
  versions of the grouper software retain the MDC that would be assigned based on the principal diagnosis and procedure codes, whereas
  other versions of the grouper software overwrite the MDC assignment with a blank, missing, or nonnumeric value such as "PRE." 
  For those users who need to construct MDC, please view the documentation and software available here:
    https://downloads.cms.gov/files/ms-drg-v37-0-r0-mce.zip
- In AHRQ software v2020, the user now has two options to calibrate smoothed rates and composite values using observed to expected ratio: 
  Option 1: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 1 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate using the 2017 HCUP reference population 
  observed-to-expected (O-E) ratio. This is recommended and is therefore the default choice.
  Option 2: Set Calibration_OE_to_ref_pop to 0 in SAS QI control programs to calibrate to the O-E ratio of the user's input data. 
  This option is provided to large health care systems or states who want to calibrate the predicted QI rates within the system. 
  The caveat is that the interpretation of the rates may be different since the software would still use 2017 
  HCUP reference population rate as multiplier for risk adjustment rates.
  For more details about the O-E ratio adjustment, please refer to the Empirical Methods document.
  https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Resources/Publications/2020/Empirical_Methods_2020.pdf
- Updated AHRQ Population file to use intercensal and postcensal estimates of county-level population by single-year age group, sex, race, 
  and Hispanic origin covering the years 2000 through 2019 from the US Census Bureau. The new population file uses Census estimates for
  single year age population to create AHRQ age bands.
- All PDI exclusions are now denominator exclusions. The small number of numerator exclusions in previous versions
  of the software are now denominator exclusions.

Version 2019, ICD-10-CM/PCS
Release date: JULY 2019
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2019 ICD-10-CM/PCS. 
 
Because of the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS, 2018 SAS QI v2019 is the first software to support risk-adjustment using ICD-10-CMS/PCS.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Added support for fiscal year 2019 code updates dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
  Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
- Introduces execution of all the supporting SAS programs from within the PDI_ALL_CONTROL.sas program.
- SAS program and control file variables were renamed to align the naming with what the module is measuring - changing
  provider to hospital.
- Modified setnames, labels, and outputs in multiple modules. See log of changes for indicator-by-indicator changes.
- Added risk-adjustment, signal variance, reference population rates, and composite weights for PDI modules using
  the 2016 HCUP state inpatient databases.
  
- Remove measures from version 2019:
	PQI 09 Low Birth Weight Rate
	NQI 01 Neonatal Iatrogenic Pneumothorax Rate
	PDI 02 Pressure Ulcer Rate
	PDI 03 Retained Surgical Item or Unretrieved Device Fragment Count
	PDI 11 Postoperative Wound Dehiscence Rate
	PDI 13 Transfusion Reaction Count
	PDI 17 Perforated Appendix Admission Rate

- Users interested in calculating expected, risk-adjusted, smoothed, or composite values must have major diagnostic categories (MDCs)
  assigned for each discharge on their input file. MDCs are used in risk adjustment, and although the QI software includes a macro to 
  calculate MDC, it does not account for assignments for pre-MDC DRGs or multiple trauma cases (MDC 24). Different versions of the MS-DRG

    https://downloads.cms.gov/files/MS-DRG-V36-0-R0-MSGMCE-V36-0-R0-MCE-V36-0-R0.zip
- Updated AHRQ Population file to use intercensal and postcensal estimates of county-level population by single-year age group, sex, race, 
  and Hispanic origin covering the years 2000 through 2018 from the US Census Bureau. The new population file uses Census estimates for
  single year age population to create AHRQ age bands.
- The naming convention for programs for measures focusing on care inside hospitals are referred to as hospital instead of provider.

Version SAS v2018, ICD-10-CM/PCS (Non-Risk Adjusted)
Release date: JUNE 2018
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This version of AHRQ's All-Payers version is named SAS QI v2018 ICD-10-CM/PCS (Non Risk Adjusted). AHRQ has revised the 
versioning approach with their software tools to better reflect the fiscal year the software tools are released, 
instead of an incremental version number. Hence, the next All-Payers release will not be called v8.0, but instead, will be 
called v2018.
 
Because of the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS, risk adjustment is not supported in the 2018 SAS 
(or in v6.0 and v7.0 beta SAS software) for ICD-10-CM/PCS. 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Added support for fiscal year 2018 code updates dictated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
  Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services(CMS).
- Consolidated formats for DIAPHRP and LUNGBIP into THORAIP due to redundancy.
- Suppressed output of NQI 02, Neonatal Mortality rate, pending technical specification review.
- Updated AHRQ Population file to use US Census 'County Population by Characteristics: 2010-2017 Vintage' tables.
  The new population file uses Census estimates for singe year age population to create AHRQ 18+ age bands, This file includes estimates for the 1995 to 2017 period.
  Population data from years 1995-1999 uses a different method for the age group (18 – 24) compared to the population data starting with 2000.

=============================================================================================
Version 7.0.1 Beta, ICD-10-CM/PCS
Release date: December 2017
-----------------------------------------
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AHRQ has named this a "beta version" as a signal to users that there may be significant differences
between results obtained when using data and QI software based on ICD-9-CM coding vs. the results 
obtained when using data and QI software based on ICD-10-CM/PCS.
Users should interpret rates using the 7.0 beta version with caution. 
A brief introduction to the differences between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM/PCS 
is available at: https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/datainnovations/BriefIntrotoICD-10Codes041117.pdf
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The v7.0.1 Beta includes updates to the PDI, PQI, and PQI09 modules.
- Added support for the updated area population file for the years 2016 and 2017.
  The population data is used in calculating the denominator of area level indicators.
  The 1995 to 2017 population file is available for download on the AHRQ SAS Software website.
  http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Software/SAS.aspx
- Except for the addition of 2016 and 2017 population data, this version is exactly same as SAS QI 7.0 Beta.
