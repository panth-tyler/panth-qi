## Issues and Bug Reports

If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature, create an **issue**:

1. Search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. If no similar issue exists, open a new one with:
   - A descriptive title.
   - A detailed description of the problem or feature request.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if it’s a bug).
   - Any relevant screenshots, logs, or links.

Tag your issues appropriately (e.g., `bug`, `feature-request`, `documentation`).

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a pull request (PR):

1. **Open an issue** to discuss the changes, unless it's a minor fix.
2. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch (see [Branch Naming Conventions](#branch-naming-conventions)).
3. Follow the **Development Workflow** below.
4. Ensure your code passes all tests and follows project coding standards.
5. Write or update relevant documentation.
6. Submit the pull request:
   - Use a clear and descriptive title.
   - Reference related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Include screenshots or logs (if applicable).

Our team will review the PR, provide feedback, and request changes if needed. Be responsive to feedback and update your PR accordingly.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Create branches with descriptive names based on the task you’re working on:

- **Features**: `feat/add-option`
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix/measures`
- **Documentation**: `docs/update-readme`

Use lowercase letters, hyphens (`-`) to separate words, and prefix branches with `feat/`, `fix/`, or `docs/`.

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard to make commit history clear and structured. Use the following format:

```bash
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]
```

### Commit Types:

- **feat**: New feature (e.g., `feat: add new CONTROL option`).
- **fix**: Bug fix (e.g., `fix: resolve MEASURES output issue`).
