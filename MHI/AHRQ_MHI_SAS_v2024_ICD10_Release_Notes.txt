The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) announces the release of the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QI) 
software for Maternal Health Indicators (MHI) Beta Version v2024 (v2024.0.1, September 2024). 

This is an update to the v2024 SAS QI software to include the MHI module.

- The MHI Beta Software includes three measures:
   • MHI 01 – Severe Maternal Morbidity Rate (20 Indicators)
   • MHI 02 – Severe Maternal Morbidity (20 Indicators) Plus In-Hospital Mortality Rate
   • MHI 03 – Refined Severe Maternal Morbidity (20 Indicators) Plus In-Hospital Mortality Rate, Beta
   
- All relevant AHRQ QI software and documentation for v2024 can be found on the AHRQ QI website at:
  https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/measures/mhi_resources. 

- The AHRQ MHI Beta Software v2024 includes codes based on the fiscal year (FY) 2024 International 
  Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS).

- The MHI observed rates were developed using multiple years of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HUP) 
  State Inpatient Databases (SID) in the reference population. The MHI beta release v2024 utilizes three years
  of data (2019-2021) in the reference population. SID for the year 2021 were available for 48 states at the 
  time of the development of v2024.

- The AHRQ MHI Beta Software v2024 is similar to the area-level QIs, in that the software calculates and 
  outputs observed rates; however, MHI rates are reports as number of events per 10,000 in-hospital stays for
  a delivery rather than using the census population as the denominator.

- MHI Beta Software does not include risk adjustment for the v2024 release; however, users can generate observed
 rates by predefined variables (RACECAT, POVCAT, STATE, YEAR, PAYER) with the option for the user to specify a
 user-defined stratum. Software instructions are included in the Quality Indicators Software Instructions
 and Data Dictionary, SAS® QI v2024, which is available at:
 https://qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Software/SAS/V2024/Software_Inst_SASQI_v2024.0.1_September_2024.pdf.
